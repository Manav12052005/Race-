DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

Please ensure that our markerbot has access to your own fork.
In your own fork, (one of your usernames should be visible in the path on the top left of the main part of the page), go to "Manage" -> "Members".
All group members should be in here, plus a special user called "comp1110-2024-s1-marker" (it is important to get the course number, year, and semester right, but it is always comp1110, regardless of whether you are enrolled in COMP1110 or COMP6710), as "Maintainer".
If this user does not appear, click the blue "Invite members" button on the top right, and enter "comp1110-2024-s1-marker" as the username.
Select "Maintainer" as the role, and do not add an expiration date.
Then click the blue "Invite" button on the bottom right.
