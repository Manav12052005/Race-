  I submit the work below for assessment as my best work. I declare that this
  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

# Use this to list names of people who you collaborated with, and a
# comment about what you collaborated on.
#
# Add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't collaborated with anyone)

# Use this to list any code that you used that you did not write,
# aside from code provided by the lecturer.  Provide a comment
# explaining your use and the URL to that code and the licence for
# that code
#
# This is also where you should declare your use of generative AI,
# e.g. Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.
#
# Add as many "url+licence+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't used any external code)
